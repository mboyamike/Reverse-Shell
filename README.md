# Reverse-Shell
This is a simple python project that demonstrates the working of a reverse shell program. It is hardcoded to use 
the local host as its server, and will therefore not work with other computers unless the IP address is changed.
It Represents my growing interest in python. Any Contributions and tips will be greatly appreciated.
